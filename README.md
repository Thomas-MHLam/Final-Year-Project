# Final-Year-Project - Smart track capture for railway defect monitoring (Industry Project - MTR)

# Objective
Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited (MTR) requests an app to detect railway defects automatically by machine. This app will perform a function with a neural network to recognize rail photos and be able to identify the type of defects or features.

# Architecture
The architecture of the neural network is ResNet18, which is a residual mapping convolutional neural network (CNN) with 18 layers. 

# Description
The code is written for Python 3.7.
