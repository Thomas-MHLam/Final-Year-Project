# Final-Year-Project - Smart track capture for railway defect monitoring (Industry Project - MTR)

# Objective
To develop an APP to enable the systematic analysis of the photographs of the rail conditions captured by the smartphone of our PWay Inspection staff and automatically recognize any abnormal patterns according to the type of rail defects like surface crack, corrugation, and wear-out. 

The APP should have a video analytic function and Machine Learning Engine to recognize the photographs and identify the type of rail defects and width of the defect (based on the width of a real rail) for further analysis.

The APP should be able to learn from the photographs collected and analyze and assign them to the appropriate category and file folder based on the location of the photo (GPS) and the size of the defects. This will enable more effective analysis and triggering of maintenance actions and timely reporting of potentially serious issues.

# Description
The code is written in jupyter notebook and the basic neural network framework is referenced from Patrick Loeber[1]. The final version of the project will be updated at the end of May 2022, which would contains the front-end code that have written for React-Native.
